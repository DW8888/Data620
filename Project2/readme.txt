🏰 Game of Thrones Bipartite Network Project

This project uses the Game of Thrones Battles and Deaths dataset from Kaggle to construct a bipartite (two-mode) network connecting characters and battles.

A character is connected to a battle if they participated, led, fought, or served as the head of a faction in that battle.
This structure allows us to explore relationships between characters through their shared involvement in conflicts.
